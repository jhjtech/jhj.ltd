BAGS or Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service offers gambling-betting services.
</p>

<p>
Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Services Ltd provides gambling and betting services.
The Company offers live and virtual greyhound racing, betting and other relevant information. 
</p>

<p>
BAGS was in desperate need of technology help. They were relying on outdated systems with large support costs,
infrastructure that was unreliable and difficult to manage, with no capability to innovate and iterate on their product. 
</p>

<p>
We worked closely with BAGS stakeholders to build a modern, scalable, and secure platform that they could build on
for the coming decades.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Saved our business huge sums of money by replacing a legacy thick client application
with a modern web based solution, removing the need for large amounts of private network infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Understanding the problem and coming up with great solutions is what these guys do, the team are
approachable and fantastic communicators to all stakeholders and their technical expertise is second to none.
</p>

<p>
The fundamentals of this platform are in the many data integrations required, we worked closely with integration partners to facilitate 10+ fully featured data integrations,
ranging from betting data to governance and compliance.  
</p>

<p>
With these integrations in place we embarked on a project to surface this data to a number
of new, purpose built front ends. 
</p>

<p>
After migrating to their new platform BAGS could decommission many other systems that
were no longer fit for purpose, this resulted in substantial cost savings.
</p>

<p>
We continue to work closely with BAGS and since 2019 have been running and supporting all of their production infrastructure and continuing to innovate on their product.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Working with BAGS has been seamless and our new platform has been well received.
It is fantastic to be a part of a long term project that has saved BAGS a substantial amount of money.
