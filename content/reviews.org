Weâ€™ve worked with JHJ a number of times over the past five years. They have contributed features and bugfixes
to our Clojure and Kotlin Spring Boot codebases.

They have always been quick to pick up the context of our codebases, flexible, and have got
started quickly.

We used JHJ to bring some additional resource into our existing engineering team and have seen value in their offerings from the beginning. It was easy to get started and
their detailed knowledge on backend systems has been invaluable.

I would thoroughly recommend their services.
